Four-Team fights =  0.692
First roles =  32
Room visits =  30
Consequent Four-Team fights =  16

Weights are  {'meets': 2, 'four_teams_total': 3, 'first_roles': 0.2, 'room_visits': 0.1, 'consequent_fours': 0.2}

Fu = 26.676

(coefficients are calibrated such way that a perfect bracket has Fu = 0 and a bracket with one basic disturbance with WEIGHT = 1 has Fu = 1)
